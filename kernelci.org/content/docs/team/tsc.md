The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is a team of people who are responsible
for keeping the KernelCI project in a good shape and driving its development.

The rules for adding or removing members from the TSC are defined in the LF
project charter.  Typically, major contributors eventually become members and
those who have stopped contributing for an extended period of time may be
removed.  This is done in agreement with the TSC and the AB.

As of today, the committee is composed of the members listed below with their
respective email address and IRC nicknames:

* [Kevin Hilman](mailto:<khilman@baylibre.com>) - `khilman`
* [Mark Brown](mailto:<broonie@kernel.org>) - `broonie`
* [Guillaume Tucker](mailto:<guillaume.tucker@collabora.com>) - `gtucker`
* [Corentin Labbe](mailto:<clabbe@baylibre.com>) - `montjoie`
* [Nikolai Kondrashov](mailto:<spbnick@gmail.com>) - `spbnick`
* [Michał Gałka](mailto:<michal.galka@collabora.com>) - `mgalka`
* [Alexandra Pereira](mailto:<alexandra.pereira@collabora.com>) - `apereira`
* [Lakshmipathi Ganapathi](mailto:<lakshmipathi.ganapathi@collabora.com>)
